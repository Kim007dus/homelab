# Homelab Automation with Ansible

This repository contains all Ansible automations for my homelab environment. The goal is to enable consistent, repeatable deployments and configurations.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Automation**: Replace manual configuration with code
- **Consistency**: Uniform setup across all homelab servers
- **Documentation**: Apply Infrastructure as Code principles
- **Scalability**: Easily add new services

## 📋 Current Playbooks

### SSL Certificate Management
Automates the creation and deployment of SSL certificates within the homelab using a self-signed Root CA (Home-CA).

**Benefits:**
- No browser warnings about insecure connections
- Full HTTPS coverage within the local network
- Centralized certificate management
- Automatic deployment to various services

**Supported services:**
- Home Assistant
- Proxmox VE
- *(Extendable for other services)*

**Usage:**

*Home Assistant:*
- Install SSH add-on
- Adjust configuration.yaml:
```yaml
http:
  ssl_certificate: /config/fullchain.pem
  ssl_key: /config/privkey.pem
```
```bash
# Run playbook
ansible-playbook -i inventories/hosts.ini ssl_certificate_management.yml --limit home_assistant
```
Restart Home Assistant via ssh: `ha core restart`

*Proxmox:*
```bash
# Run playbook
ansible-playbook -i inventories/hosts.ini ssl_certificate_management.yml --limit proxmox
```
Restart Proxmox: `systemctl restart pveproxy`
